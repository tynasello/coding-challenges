Leetcode 153, Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted ArraySuppose an array of length n sorted in 
ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 
1 time results in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

class Solution:
    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        l = 0
        r = len(nums) - 1

        while l < r:
            m = l + (r-l)//2
            if nums[m] < nums[r]:
                r = m
            else:
                l = m + 1

        return nums[l]
